2. brain-even (gives a random number, you have to determine whether it is even or not)
3. brain-prime (gives a random number, you have to determine whether it is prime or not)
4. brain-progression (gives a random arefmitic progression, you have to identify the missing digit)
5. brain_gcd (gives two random numbers, you have to determine the greatest common divisor)
